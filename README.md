Factorial & Fibonacci with Runtime Analysis
This repository contains two C++ programs:-
-> (fibonacci_sequence) generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given term and also uses clock() function to measure the runtime and display the time taken
-> (factorial_numbers) computes the factorial of a number and also measures the runtime using clock()
